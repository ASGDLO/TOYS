1. Federal Investigators Probe Cryptocurrency Firm Tether
Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are investigating cryptocurrency firm Tether for potential violations of sanctions and anti-money-laundering regulations. The inquiry centers on whether Tether's cryptocurrency, pegged to the US dollar, has been used by third parties to fund illegal activities or launder money. The US Treasury is also contemplating sanctioning Tether due to its connections with sanctioned entities like Hamas and Russian arms dealers. Previously, Tether faced regulatory issues, paying $61 million to settle claims of asset misrepresentation. The firm maintains it actively combats illicit activity and has recently enhanced its surveillance measures and froze nearly 1,850 crypto wallets. The probe comes amid broader federal scrutiny of the cryptocurrency industry, including significant actions against other major players. Tether's ties with Cantor Fitzgerald and its political connections could complicate the situation if criminal charges are pursued.

2. Crypto Firms Flood PACs with Donations in Hope Candidates Will Relax Regulations
Cryptocurrency companies have become major players in the 2024 presidential election, contributing nearly half of all corporate donations, totaling over $119 million. Leading donors include Coinbase and Ripple, which have collectively provided 80% of these contributions. Donations are channeled mainly into a bipartisan super PAC, Fairshake, which supports pro-crypto candidates. Critics, including Public Citizen's Rick Claypool, argue this spike in donations is an attempt to silence opposition and represents issues caused by the Citizens United ruling. High-profile figures like former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have shown support for crypto-friendly policies, aiming to attract the industry's backing.
